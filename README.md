# SeizureDetection-TransformerModel
A seizure detection model built using the Transformer model archietecture and EEGNet to identify seiz/bckg based on EEG data from the TUH EEG seizure corpus.

# Overview
This work was done as part of NSF undergraduate research with the goal of modifying code based on a previous seizure detection model from Yuanda Zhu and Prof. May D. Wang [repo](https://github.com/UnitedHolmes/seizure_detection_EEGs_transformer_BHI_2023) to be compatible with the newest data in the TUH EEG seizure corpus, Version 2.0.3.
